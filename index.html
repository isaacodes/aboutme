                satisfied with where it is at as of right now. This project is constantly evolving and I do not see an
                end for it in the near future at all. It is completely open source and free to use. I hope that anyone
                who chooses to use it will find it helpful and fun!</div>

            <div class="description">
                This is a version of the popular game show "Jeopardy!" that I made a while back. While it may not look
                the best, it sure does function well! I made this one for one of my teachers so that we could play
                Jeopardy in class on the projector screen. I had a lot of fun making this, and a lot of fun playing it
                with my family!

            <div class="description">When I design a website, I tend to stick to a very minimalistic theme. If too much
                is going on on a webpage, a user can feel lost, and I know that that feeling is not a pleasant one. To
                lessen this effect on my users, I like to make my websites easy to navigate while still maintaining a
                pleasing look and feel.
