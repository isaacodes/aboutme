            <div class="description">
                This is a version of the popular game show "Jeopardy!" that I made a while back. While it may not look
                the best, it sure does function well! I made this one for one of my teachers so that we could play
                Jeopardy in class on the projector screen. I had a lot of fun making this, and a lot of fun playing it
                with my family!

            <div class="description">When I design a website, I tend to stick to a very minimalistic theme. If too much
                is going on on a webpage, a user can feel lost, and I know that that feeling is not a pleasant one. To
                lessen this effect on my users, I like to make my websites easy to navigate while still maintaining a
                pleasing look and feel.

            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Tennessee, the child of two wonderful parents. I have two younger brothers and currently I
                live in Florida. I first started programming when I was 9. Later on this page, you can hear the
                backstory as to how I began coding. Since I began coding, I have learned a lot of languages (including
                PHP, which I didn't use much and have almost entirely forgotten). I have also made a lot of projects in
                my time coding. This year, my 8<sup>th</sup> grade year, I am taking a Web Design class, and I recently
                (on Februrary 12, 2020) passed the Microsoft Technology Associate test and certified.

            <h3>Future Education</h3>
            <p>
                For my high school career, I have planned out going to Collegiate (a charter school in Niceville,
                Florida). I have earned the credits to be able to apply to this school. I have applied and I am awaiting
                the lottery to see if I will be able to attend. If I am not able to, I will attend Niceville High
                School.

            <h2>How I started programming</h2>
            <p>
                When I was 9, I had a very old and crappy computer. I didn't have any fancy text editor, and the one
                that I used didn't even support links. I was trying to replicate a webpage just using this text editor,
                so I went to my dad to ask how to add a link to the document. Instead of showing me how to do this
                (probably because he couldn't), my dad showed me how to make a link in HTML. Immediately, I started
                playing around with this. One of the first projects that I remember creating was a word scramble game,
                using a combination of a little CSS, HTML links, and a <strong>whole lot</strong> of web pages. For
                every link that someone clicked on the document, that person would be taken to a page that represented
                the choice they made: if it was wrong, they went back to the beginning of the word (there were 3 words).
                If the choice was correct, they were taken to a page that moved the correct choice to the front of the
                word (where it belonged), and then it went on and on and on until you got all three words. After I
                showed this to my dad, he told me that I should start learning JavaScript. So I did. We went to my local
                Barnes and Noble and picked out a book called "JavaScript for Kids" by Nick Morgan. I would ask my dad
                what some things were, but otherwise, I learned JavaScript from this book and Stack Overflow. Since that
                time, I have made a lot of projects, many of which I have since deleted, but I am also currently working
                on a few projects that won't be going away any time soon.
            </p>
